This directory contains codes that are used to generate the monthly time series figures that are posted on the MERRA-2 Annual Cycle instance of FLUID. Additionally, latestyear_spaghetti_ncaregions_statD.py will produce a daily version of the figures for temperature, however, due to the additional computational burden of daily data points, statistics for the mean and percentiles must be pre-computed ahead of time.
